# Library-MS

With students, libraries may be one of our most important destinations for learning, studying, and exploring things. In the modern days, the more technology develops, the more diverse the means of storing information. Therefore, the management and development of these means are increasingly focused on. Libraries are a great place to do that. Therefore, the development of library management systems is contributing to bringing that precious information to people effectively and quickly.

My simple project is to develop IS, a library management system that helps users easily find the necessary documents in the library quickly at home without having to stand for hours in the library to search. In addition, IS is an effective user information and data management tool for librarians.
